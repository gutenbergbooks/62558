<h2><i>Drippings From the Fawcett</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Three weeks of Havana’s cliquot, bacardi,
cervesa, horse races, jai alai, casino, and
the rattly-bang-bang, of garbage cans,
piercing shrieks of peddlers, not to mention
rip-snorting roaring and exhausted automobiles,
have had their exhilarating effects on the
usual hum drum existence that has been my
part of living on a quiet Minnesota farm. The
contrast is pleasant although somewhat tiresome.
There’s been too much excitement for
the little old editor of this family journal of
travel.</p>

<p>Sometime in the dim and distant past I was
told that the most difficult feature in writing
was to transcribe the first paragraph. My
hardest job here is to stay away from the
Scotch and soda long enough to even think
what the first paragraph will look like. However,
with the able assistance of my good old
pals, the Haig brothers, I am at last seated by
a rickety old dining room table in an apartment
overlooking the Malecon, Morro Castle and the
Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>Confucius once said: “It is not the wine
that makes a man drunk—it is the man himself.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
This filosophy applies to Cuba today. I
have seen more “saloons” in Havana and fewer
intoxicated persons than in any city in the
United States, both before and since the adoption
of the prohibition amendment.</p>

<p>The easy manner in which we Americans
can get borie-eyed drunk on a few shots of
moonshine reminds of the Wag Jag ditty about</p>

<div class="verse"><i>DeGulick McBlue, psychological stew,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Could always get tight on one small shot or two—</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Far from proving his worldliness, toughness and such.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>It all went to show that he couldn’t stand much.</i></div>

<p>In Havana it is forbidden by law to kiss your
wife on the gang-plank, in a taxi or other public
place. The usual fine for violation is $25.</p>

<p>Spooning custom here is quite different, too.
In Cuba every residential window is protected
by iron bars similar to our jails. It is through
these barriers that lovers must cuddle and coo—at
least until he becomes so nervous and
tired from continual standing that he pops the
question. I know it would be rather tough on
some of our Minnesota farmhands if the farmers
should adopt a custom similar to Cuba.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">The first thing I learned in Havana was
that the Cubans do not like the Whiz
Bang’s traveling correspondent, Rev.
“Golightly” Morrill. Mr. Morrill’s name is
anathema to the average native, due undoubtedly
to the fact that our reverend friend rarely
deals out his views of life with kid gloves. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
sees the world from the standpoint of the betterment
of humanity and in seeking to attain
his end, strikes out in two-fisted manner.</p>

<p>In republishing a recent Morrill article from
this magazine, a Havana publication takes this
rap at our correspondent:</p>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>The Rev. “Golightly” Morrill is still tramping
around the world seeking muck in which to wallow.
After his experience in the West Indies and Central
America it was not to be supposed that he would find
anything very bad to write about, but it seems that he
has discovered familiar iniquities on the beaches of
California.</p>

the close of one evening, lured by broken

<p class="dropcap">Ever since the death of our good neighbor,
Cyrus Hopkins, his lonely widow has
made a conscientious study of spiritualism.
The other morning Mrs. Hopkins visited
a Minneapolis medium in the hopes she might
communicate with her late husband. The connection
soon was made and the following conversation
took place:</p>

<p>“Is this you, Cyrus?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p>“Are you happy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p>“Happier than when you were with me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">How, Kind and Forbearing Readers of this
great encyclopedia of Psychic Research,
better known as The Whiz Bang, pause a
moment while Ye Ed relates how Sir Harry
Lauder indirectly caused me much embarrassment.</p>

<p>While lunching at the Friars’ Club on my
last visit to New York City, I was cordially invited
to a big reception at the Hotel Commodore
in honor of Sir Harry Lauder, famous Scottish
comedian. The momentous night arrived and
I donned by “Sunday-go-to-meeting” clothes for
the great event. Please try to imagine my
chagrin and sheepishness when friends who had
called to escort me, very courteously and, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
might add, diplomatically informed me that “it
was to be a full dress affair.” How in heck
could a horny-handed tiller of the soil be expected
to possess a dress suit? After thanking
my kind auditors in as gracious a manner as
possible, I suggested that probably Sir Harry
might consider overalls more appropriate for
me. Anyway I did not attend the reception.
Next day my Friar friends told me about it and
I was happily regaled with Scottish humor.
The chairman, they said, graciously introduced
Lauder as his “closest friend.” Will these jokes
on Sir Harry’s thrift never cease?</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">During recent pilgrimages that carried
me east, west, north and south, I ran
across many amusing, although sometimes
embarrassing situations. Chief among
them was the constantly manifested surprise
of newly-found friends that there was actually
such a personage, in flesh and blood, as Captain
Bilious Billy.</p>

<p>Here is a fair list of the questions usually
dished out by new acquaintances:</p>

<p>“Why, I supposed the Whiz Bang was only
‘kidding’ and that ‘Captain Billy’ was merely
a book name.”</p>

<p>“And do you really drink that horrid moonshine?”</p>

<p>“Did you have a hired man named Gus?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is Pedro your honest-to-goodness pedigreed
bull?”</p>

<p>“Is there actually a town named Robbinsdale?”</p>

<p>“Did a honeymooning couple really leave
their automobile seat with you when they went
to the village constable to report the theft of
their car?”</p>

<p>It was necessary to plead guilty to nearly
all the allegations heaped on me. Of course,
poor Pedro is no more, he having “kicked the
bucket” last July, and Gus, too, has sorta back-slid.
Gus always was an in-and-outer anyway.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p>Gus, my old time hired man, has busted into
poetry again. The old boy must be getting a
whiff of the pine forests about Breezy Point
Lodge. Well, here you go, Gus,—we’ll publish
this one:</p>

<h3>The Ornery Pups</h3>

<p>A traveler in the Tennessee mountains
sought refuge one evening at a wayside cabin.</p>

<p>He had traveled all one chill, April day and
was cold, hungry and footsore. With true
mountain hospitality the old mountaineer invited
him to supper, and insisted that he spend
the night.</p>

<p>The host made him comfortable before a
huge open fireplace, and set a jug of mountain
dew beside his chair. Also introduced him to
his eighteen-year-old daughter, who was the
only other occupant of the cabin, unless we may
include four lank hounds stretched before the
fireplace.</p>

<p>The old man hastened out to look after his
chores and the girl busied herself in the kitchen.</p>

<p>The cabin was typical of the region, having
two rooms, one containing a bed and two chairs,
and the other serving as kitchen and dining
room.</p>

<p>The traveler, left to himself, took three or
four heavy shots of the moonshine and soon
forgot his weariness and the chill of the April
day. He divested himself of his shoes, settled
himself with a sigh of content, and steamed his
sopping feet in the glow of the fire.</p>

<p>Shortly one of the hounds raised his head,
languidly, and sniffed suspiciously.</p>

<p>He scrambled to his feet, howled mournfully
and dived beneath the bed, the others following
him as if they had gone crazy. A piteous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
whining and snarling issued from under the
bed for several minutes, and the traveler became
alarmed. The dogs must be mad.</p>

<p>He arose and opened the door, and the dogs
shot from under the bed, and through the open
door. Each departed, howling as if St. Nick
was after him.</p>

<p>It was puzzling to say the least.</p>

<p>The comely daughter entered the room
shortly, and the traveler addressed her as follows:</p>

<p>“What is the matter with those dogs?” he
inquired.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” she replied, “Lessem one uv ’em
brung somepin dead indoors. Dad allus kicks
hell out’en the whole passell uv them when they
do thet.”</p>

<h3>The Young Gringo</h3>

“Ron Bacardi Superior,” hath driven ye old cap’n to lyrical
lines of lisping lingo. So I sit me down on my cane bottom

Cholo rhyme, “The Young Gringo.” The poem has to do
with the proper actions of Americans in Cuba, and other

<h3>’Sa Nice Day, Haintit?</h3>

<p>A stuttering man walked up to a boy who
had a parrot in a cage and said, “Ca—ca—can
tha—tha—that parrot talk?”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the boy, “if he couldn’t talk
better than you I’d kill him.”</p>

<h3>This Sounds Like Bull</h3>

<p>A visitor who was stopping at a hotel was
much disturbed by the snoring of one of his
friends sleeping in an adjoining room. Suddenly
the snore ceased and death-like stillness
oppressed the listener. Thinking that something
had happened to his friend, he went into
his room, and found him sitting up in bed.
The friend said, “I was sleeping with my mouth
open, and I think I have swallowed a mouse.”</p>

<p>The hotel doctor was sent for, who adopted
the novel expedient of calling in the services of
the hotel cat, and placed a piece of toasted
cheese some little distance from the patient’s
mouth, thinking that the mouse, smelling the
cheese, would come out to eat it and would fall
a prey to the cat. While the remedy was working,
the doctor went downstairs to get a drink,
and the patient fell asleep and resumed his
snoring.</p>

<p>When the doctor returned the cat was missing.</p>

<h3>Pat’s Hole</h3>

<p>Pat was hard at work digging a post-hole,
when the boss strolled by. “Well, Pat,” said he,
noting the progress of the work, “do you think
you will be able to get all that dirt back into
the hole again?”</p>

<p>Pat looked doubtfully at the pile of dirt,
and after some thought, said: “No, sor. Sure,
I don’t think I’ve dug the hole deep enough.”</p>

<h2><i>Mirrors of Life and Love</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="center">BY PRINCESS BIBESCO<br />
Daughter of Margot Asquith</p>

<p class="hanging">LOVE—“Isn’t that what love means, to fill
ordinary, commonplace conventional things
with magic and significance, not to need the
moon and white scent-heavy flowers at night?
* * * You talk about love. What a
strange, restricted growth it is with you. You
don’t know what the real thing means, you
who think passion is bad taste because you
are not tempted, you to whom the physical
side is a degrading extra.” * * * When
he was with her now he stammered. He
didn’t know that a stammer is the divine
eloquence of love.</p>

<p class="hanging">PASSION—Passion is no respecter of persons.
She hardly seems to select her victims. How
many a would-be Juliet waits in vain for
those consuming fires her heart is longing
for, while they blaze in the reluctant hearts
of Mr. Adrian Roses, who only ask to be
left in peace, far from the ridiculous and,
thank God, equally far from the sublime.
Are men in love like this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging-x">“She was the first person he had ever loved.
He had trembled when he touched her. His
spasms of passion had been like spasms of
pain, his face contorted and his voice rough,
and then there had followed intervals of
wretched shyness. When he had thought of
possessing her he had become a saint waiting
for a divine manifestation.”</p>

<p class="hanging">MARRIAGE—“We just are hopelessly unsuited
to each other. Do you seriously think that
you want a wife like me?” * * * “Marriage
will modify you.” * * * “Marriage might
modify me if I married the right man. Marriage
to you would bring out everything you
hate.” * * * “Helena, do you realize that
I love you?” “You don’t know what love
means.” * * * “Of course I don’t. If I
did I might want to marry you.”</p>

<p class="hanging">PROTEST AGAINST REALISM—“What is it
one yearns for? It is to be able to do a thing
for the first time again. And that is impossible.
When I love, what do I want? I
want never to have kissed, never to have given
myself before. It is in vain, I say—‘Never
before was I awake—I was a dummy in the
hands of fate—now I am alive.’ I was shut
up perhaps, but my outer petals were touched.
Oh, my God, make me again the child I was—but
He cannot answer.”</p>

<p class="hanging">DISILLUSIONMENT—What are we to tell
our children? How are they to know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the first accidental encounter with life may
take from them a treasure they will only
learn about in forty storm-tossed years?
Those first gifts—those shy blossomings
lovely in their unconsciousness—are surely
but the squandering of something half alive,
the foolish murder of a bud. Oh, youth is a
wicked, cruel thing, eating miracles with its
breakfast and not knowing they are not porridge.</p>

<p class="hanging">WHAT A WOMAN WANTS—“I don’t want
anything except to be wanted. I long for you
to make ceaseless, impossible demands on me.”</p>

<p class="hanging">THE GOAL OF HUMAN ACHIEVEMENT—“All
my life I have been teased for asking
not, ‘Is she beautiful?’ ‘Is she clever?’ but
always ‘Is she happy?’ I think it is in many
ways the most interesting thing about a person.
* * * Happiness is a light, an atmosphere,
an illumination. It sets a personality.
I always feel it is a creation that is difficult
for some and easy for others, but essentially
an achievement, never an accident.”</p>

<p>Henpecked and haggard husband asked the

<h3>Unrequited Love</h3>

<p class="center sans">By Walter Scott Haskell.</p>

<p class="smaller">In the place first, I want it understood that I am a
California cousin to a doughboy’s cootie.</p>

<p class="smaller">When first I clapped my binnacle lights on the robust
form of Susanna, I knew that she was my meat, vulgarly
speaking. I loved her very avoirdupois, and that was
going some, as she was no light article. I took her gauge
one evening as we sat in the parlor and I snuggled up
to her in a most friendly fashion. My advances were
met with cold resentment. She did not say a word, but
she jammed my head against her corset in a manner that
bespoke her an amazon of no mean physical power. I
thought my spinal column was broken; but when she
let go, I breathed a sigh of relief and was contented to
just look at her and nurse my sprained parts. I decided
to use diplomacy, and waited until she had taken herself
to the arbor hammock in the garden to indulge in an
afternoon siesta. I watched around, and when I saw her
eyelids droop and close, her breast heave in regular
breathing as one asleep, I made my way to her side and
bent over her fair face. How my mouth watered for a
bite of her, but I almost feared that she would wake and
lam me in the jaw. Temptation was too strong, however,
and in an evil moment I turned my attention to her roll-down
stocking that showed a goodly proportion of her
nether parts. With a kind of subdued clicking of my
jaws, I put my lips to her bare knee and experienced the
joy of a stolen kiss. It may have been a disgraceful act,
anyway the tickle of my touch awoke her, and she kicked
unmercifully, like a cow that will not be milked. I
ducked and escaped death, with a mouthful of her blood,
the best that I had ever had, for she was my meat, and
I am a California flea.</p>

<h3>Kablegram Love</h3>

<p>She was a pretty and ambitious girl and
had studied the matrimonial problem to a
nicety.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose I shall wed eventually,” she
said, “but the only kind of masculine nuisance
that will suit me must be tall and dark, with
classical features. He must be brave, yet
gentle. Withal he must be strong—a lion
among men, but a knight among ladies.”</p>

<p>That even a bow-legged, lath-framed youth,
wearing checked trousers and smoking a cigarette
that smelt worse than a burning boot,
rattled on the back door and the girl knocked
four tumblers and a cut glass fruit dish off the
sideboard in her haste to get to him.</p>

<h3>No Offense Here, Paddy</h3>

<p>An Irishman while on his way to call upon
his best girl suddenly caught sight of a beautiful
parrot in a nearby tree.</p>

<p>He decided it would be just the present for
her. Slowly he drew near the bird and upon
reaching one of the highest branches, was just
about to grab his prey when the parrot,
who had been eyeing him sharply, suddenly
squawked, “Well, what do you want?”</p>

<p>Pat withdrew his hand and humbly made
answer, “Excuse me. Er—I thought you was a

<h3>Proudie! Proudie!</h3>

<p>A well-known actor was introduced to a
chap who didn’t strike him particularly because
he was prejudiced against men who talk in
soprano voices. The next time they met he
ignored the fellow entirely. A few days later
he ran across the fellow again, but his face was
still frozen.</p>

<p>The fourth meeting occurred in a cafe, and
he of the soprano voice waltzed up to the disgusted
actor’s table.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” he said, “we have met three
times and you weally haven’t noticed me?”
Then with a sibilant lisp in a high C that nobody
in the cafe could miss, he gave the actor
three little dabs on the shoulder and squeaked,
“Proudie! Proudie! Proudie!”</p>

In many months he never missed a morning.
Then the inevitable happened—Sandy was absent.
His fellow golfers, worried lest Sandy be
ill, sought him out.</p>

<p>They found the old Highlander in apparently
good health. Sandy refused to explain
his absence from the course until after vigorous
questioning.</p>

<p>“A famous, or rather a notorious professional
beauty, visited Constantinople. Her
charms worked havoc among the Turkish
nobility. The sultan himself was smitten.</p>

<p>“At a dinner party on her return, King
Edward, then the Prince of Wales, questioned
her about her Turkish conquests.</p>

<p>“‘You made a great hit with the sultan, I
believe?’ he said.</p>

<p>“‘The sultan,’ she answered with enthusiasm,
‘is a dear. He conferred this decoration on
me.’</p>

<p>“And she displayed a jeweled emblem which
glistened on her white bosom royally.</p>

<p>“‘It’s the order of virtue,’ she explained,
and then, lowering her eyes, she added—‘of the
second class.’”</p>

<h2><i>Whiz Bang Editorials</i></h2>

<p class="by"><i>“The Bull is Mightier Than the Bullet.”</i></p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Recently there came to our notice a
booklet containing what purports to be a
sermon delivered by one Bob Shuler, pastor
of the Trinity Methodist Church, Los Angeles,
bearing on its cover the statement that it
is “published in pamphlet form because of the
utter impossibility of securing the publication
of such a discussion through any Los Angeles
daily newspaper.”</p>

<p>Taking for his text, “The Movie Industry
vs. The Public,” Rev. Shuler devotes approximately
four thousand words to what seems first
a conviction and then a trial of the only screen
star ever charged with a felony. He says:</p>

<p>“That he was directly and absolutely responsible
for her death, I am certain.”</p>

<p>The worthy pastor then proceeds with the
admission that “the attitude of the movie luminaries
toward the marriage relation; their
continuous ‘souse’ in divorce and scandal; their
quarter of a century of screened sex appeal;
* * * the evident looseness that has sprung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
up among them; their booze parties; their
cigarette smoking beauties; their behavior as
reported by scores who live neighbor to their
studios; * * * all has forced me against
my will and over my protest to believe that a
majority of the movie crowd are of the same
stripe * * *.”</p>

<p>Having already found him guilty, Dr. Shuler
then asks whether this actor is a fair, fit sample
of a type, and promptly answers his question
by saying:</p>

<p>“I think you will have no trouble in recognizing
that he is a most splendid example of a
type, a most certain sample, of a variety of folk
who have decided to be the independent authors
of their own standards of morality or immorality,
without regard to or respect for the public.”</p>

<p>On the same day there was brought to us a
copy of a daily newspaper containing about
four thousand words under the heading, “In
Loving Memory of Harry S. Duffield,” being
a transcript of an eulogy delivered a few weeks
ago by James Neill at the bier of his brother-actor
and lifelong friend, from which we quote:</p>

<p>“In all these years I never heard from these
dead lips one irreverent oath. His thoughts
were white and his speech was clean. By nature
he was devotional. He believed in church
attendance and private prayer, and in the constant
reference of daily concerns to Divine
guidance. His reputation for gentle judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of his fellows was well known. Save to report
good of his fellowman, he spoke not at all.
* * * So good-bye forever, dear Harry Duffield,
our best beloved, and may the dear, gentle
God be very tender with you and give you everlasting
peace and rest.”</p>

<p>What power is theirs to soften pain, to educate,
to instruct, when sent on some constructive
mission.</p>

<p>And what a world of destruction they can
accomplish when their author’s purpose is to
gain notoriety through misrepresentation, to
besmirch clean men and women by fastening to
a majority the alleged shortcomings of a few,
and to entirely disregard the command of our
Creator, “Judge not that ye be not judged.”</p>

<h3>The Difference</h3>

<p>Marshal Petain, before he married, was once
delivering some pretty frank invective against
marriage in the presence of some friends. He
ended by saying nearly all married couples led
a cat-and-dog life. “But, look here,” said one
friend, “that’s an absurdly sweeping statement.
Besides, cats and dogs don’t always
quarrel. Look at those two on your hearth at
this moment. They get on well together.” Petain
smiled. “Tie them together and watch,”
he said.</p>

<h2><i>Confessions of a Bride</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="center"><i>A Daily Newspaper Raving</i></p>

<p class="dropcap">“Call up a steeple-jack today and get
him to paint the flag pole on the
garage,” said Warren as he finished his
sixth helping of ham and eggs, and folded the
morning paper preparatory to leaving for the
office. “Why, Warren,” Helen exclaimed, “I
can do the job as well as a steeple-jack, and
the money saved can be used to buy a new
worm for our still; the old one is almost worn
out.”</p>

<p>Since Warren’s salary had been reduced
from $3,000 to $2,984 a month Helen had
watched every dollar, and the thought of paying
a man 50 or 75 cents to paint the flag pole
caused big tears to form in her eyes and run
down her cheeks into the platter of fried mock
turtle, which was her favorite breakfast dish.</p>

<p>“There, there, little wife, don’t cry,” pleaded
Warren, placing an arm on her shoulder and
gently kicking her back of the right ear, “We’ll
say no more about the matter today, but if I
hear of you trying to climb that flag pole I’ll
cave in half a dozen of your ribs” and flinging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
her a kiss he dashed blithely out of the house
and hailing a passing whisky runner’s car, was
soon out of sight on his way to work.</p>

<p>Helen busied herself around the house and
tried to keep her mind off of the painting job.
Since they had dispensed with the services of
three maids and there was no one to assist her
with the house work except Bridget, the
Japanese house girl, there was much for her
to do. Getting Baby Winifred ready for school
was the biggest task, and this morning the little
girl was more unruly than ever. Only by
giving her a large glass of potato whisky
mixed with snuff, of which the child was
intensely fond could Helen induce her to stop
breaking the cut glass decanters on the
sideboard, and allow herself to be dressed.</p>

<p>Making out the order for the butcher shop
occupied three hours, and when that was done
it was time for her music lesson, for Helen
never allowed anything to interfere with her
musical education, and at ten o’clock she seated
herself at the Victrola and under the skillful
tutelage of her teacher she was soon able to
play the overture from “Lily of the Alley.”</p>

<p>From eleven until two was spent in eating
a light lunch, and then Jacquiline Olson
dropped in to complain about Mabel, Helen’s
pet cobra, biting her little boy. The Olson
woman was always distasteful to Helen and
when she requested that the snake be kept tied
up during the summer months, Helen arose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
majestically and with a deft uppercut knocked
her over three chairs into the wood-box, where
she lay moaning feebly and offered no resistance
when Helen carried her over to the window and
dropped her with a crash into the alley.</p>

<p>Most women would have considered their
day wrecked after such an incident, but Helen,
after draining a dipperful of hemlock wine,
dismissed the affair from her mind and started
to repair one of the dining room chairs she had
broken in a friendly argument with Warren
the evening before. After several futile
attempts to make the glue stick she gave it
up as a bad job and flung the chair in the bath
tub where she was certain Warren would not
see it for months. Then the telephone rang
and a deep bass voice informed her that Baby
Winifred had been arrested for throwing rocks
at the statue of Benedict Arnold in front of the
city hall.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s nothing I can do till Warren
comes home,” said Helen as she hung up the
receiver and went out in the back yard to dig a
hole to bury the neighbor’s bull dog which
Pussy Purr-mew had just dragged in the house.
“I wish the dear thing wouldn’t bring home all
the dogs she kills,” sighed Helen, “but I suppose
she wants to show me what a good fighter she
is.”</p>

<p>After burying the dog, Helen went back to
the house and picking up the latest issue of
Naughty Stories, soon was so interested that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
she did not hear the voices of the men at the
front door when they brought Warren home
from the office, drunk, and dumped him on
the front porch, where he lay until she stumbled
over him an hour later.</p>

<p>By this time Warren was sober enough to
eat supper, which he did in a silence only
broken when he inhaled the soup and drank his
coffee.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you talk to me?” Helen
demanded toward the end of the meal. “Don’t
sit there like a dummy and never say a word.
Men are such brutes!” And throwing herself
behind the kitchen stove she wept bitterly.</p>

<div class="verse">Us two was pals, the Kid and me;</div>

<h3>The Piping Costs</h3>

<p>The colored minister had just concluded a
powerful sermon on “Salvation is Free” and
was announcing that a collection would be
taken. Up jumped a brother in the back of
the church. “If salvation is free,” he interrupted,
“what’s the use paying for it? I’m
going to give you nothing till I find out.
Now—”</p>

<p>“Patience, brother, patience,” said the parson.
“I’ll illustrate. Suppose you were
thirsty and came to a river. You could kneel
right down and drink, couldn’t you? And it
would cost you nothing, would it?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. That’s just what I—”</p>

<p>“That water would be free,” continued the
parson. “But supposing you were to have that
water piped to your house, you would have to
pay, would you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but—”</p>

<p>“Well, brother, salvation is free, but it is
the having it piped to you that you got to pay
for. Pass the hat, sexton.”</p>

<h2><i>Chinese Nightmare Cities</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="center">BY REV. “GOLIGHTLY” MORRILL<br />
Pastor People’s Church, Minneapolis, Minn.</p>

<p class="dropcap">All aboard for China, the country of Confucius
and chop suey! At Canton a wonderful
spectacle took place at the wharf.
A sampan man had beaten his wife and thrown
her on the dock where she sat and chanted in a
monotonous voice while a hundred coolies gathered
round and watched the interesting ceremony.
She referred to her husband and his ancestors,
then scraped up a little pile of dirt,
spat on it, molded it into the image of a man,
addressed it with a few words, suddenly knelt
and foully insulted it, and so eased her conscience,
balanced the books of honor and “saved
her face.”</p>

<p>From the Hotel Victoria in the Shameen, or
Foreign Quarter, two cadaverous coolies carried
me in a coffin-shaped sedan chair across
a stinking canal into native Canton. My guide,
Ah Cum, led the way. The streets were so
narrow and the show windows so near that I
could have been a shoplifter with both hands.
If hungry, there was a free lunch counter extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
along the streets with tea and rice, live
fish, glazed ducks, gory pigs, a choice assortment
of fresh entrails, some dead dogs and rats,
crates of yowling cats, and huge pots of slimy
soup thickened with animal, vegetable and
other matter that would make the Witches’
Cauldron in “Macbeth” look like a cup of consomme
in comparison.</p>

<p>At the Temple of the Five Hundred Genii,
where the prayers of the holy had given way
to the harangues of the politicians, I saw a
gilded statue big as life of the first European
globe-trotter to China, Marco Polo. Such a
traveler was a novelty then, but now is a nuisance.
I went by old walls whose painted
dragons the new Chinese had wiped out; by
temples whose only occupants were a few second-hand
gods and bats; took time to visit the
water-clock tower where drops of water instead
of grains of sand mark the time of China’s
millions towards the grave; passed through
gates of the old city wall to the hillside where
hundreds had been shot; looked into the graveyard
where the poor common people rest after
life’s fitful fever, while the restless rich, who
shunned them in life, lie apart from them in
the City of the Dead.</p>

<p>Like mummies in a museum, they sleep unburied
in their rich caskets and await the
grafting geomancer, that oriental undertaker,
who promises the relatives to find some place
in the ground undisturbed by the Great Dragon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
By the religious milestone of the five-storied,
weedy, seedy Pagoda, whose oracles are dumb,
I headed for the Execution Grounds in the pottery
district where the sharp sword had sent
many a man back to his original clay.</p>

<p>China is becoming civilized now and stands
her criminals up against a wall and shoots
them. Here was a narrow alley lined with
earthen pots covered with mats, under which
were fleshless skulls. One of them seemed to
look imploringly at me, and I picked it up.
Alas, some poor Chinese Yorick! I was anxious
to see the man who struck the fearful blows,
and Ah Cum called the executioner who came
out with a knife estimated to have cut off 300,000
heads in thirty years. There is a death
here by “seventy-two cuts,” but one from his
sword was enough.</p>

<p>Bayard Taylor said China was a good place
to leave, and I was not very sorry when the
whistle blew to cast off and say good-bye to the
city of dreadful sights, sounds, suffering and
smells. Leaving the grotesque outline of an old
fort, a little island stained by some dark murder,
a place where pirates had scuttled a ship,
a picturesque Pagoda looking like an eight-story
Easter bonnet, Grecian-bend shaped junk-boats
and sampans like big, broken barrels
floating along, we sailed down the Pearl River
and at midnight reached the Portuguese town of
Macao. On deck we were surprised to find the
officers embracing the coolies. Were they trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to relieve them of their hard-earned spoils
of fan-tan which they had won during the
night? No, the honest officials were only
searching for concealed arms, but found only
those which Nature had allowed and provided.</p>

<p>An illuminated sign, “First-class Gambling
House,” drew my attention. Gambling, next to
loafing and the manufacture of opium, is the
principal occupation of the youngest and oldest
inhabitants. Macao is the Oriental Monte
Carlo. Gambling here is backed by the government
which gets back a certain per cent of the
earnings which it invests in hospitals, asylums
and cheap lodgings for the people who have
been beaten at the game. At this gambling-hell
one could play at the big table downstairs,
or drop into the game by lowering his money
in a small basket from the balcony above. Tired
of the game, the player recuperates his wasted
energies here by eating bird-nest soup and
shark-fins, or drinking Portuguese wines. If
he is sleepy, he may take the opium-pipe train
of thought to the Flowery Land where every-day
is Sunday.</p>

<p>At a “song-parlor” some Chinese dolls
amused us with their squeaky voices and knife-scraping
music. It sadly recalled my visit to a
Hongkong house of pleasure whose almond-eyed
inmates illustrated Confucius’ remark that
“women had no souls,” and the Chinese philosophy
which attributes death and evil to Yin,
the female principle in Nature. Their artificially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
whitened and rouged faces were ghastly,
and their flower-and-jewel-bedecked hair glued
down to the skull was anything but attractive
to an Occidental eye. Their lips were red like
the dawn of day, their complexions like congealed
ointment, and their betel-nut-stained
teeth like black watermelon seeds. They unfurled
painted fans, sipped tea, nibbled sweetmeats,
puffed at opium-pipes, and looked quite
flowery in their blue collars, purple tunics and
bright green trousers. I wonder if the men,
whom they were entertaining, remembered the
Chinese proverb, “There is no such poison in
the green snake’s mouth or in the hornet’s sting
as in a woman’s heart.”</p>

<p>After visiting next day a firecracker factory,
temples, joss-houses, and a tobacco plant
where little children and old women were at
work sorting the leaves, I was conducted to
Macao’s notorious opium factory. I entered a
low-ceiling room where men were stripped to
their waists like blacksmiths at the forge. They
picked up the crude opium, shaped like a cocoanut
shell, scooped out the chocolate-looking substance,
threw it into a kind of brass wash-basin
under which roared the fire, until it steamed
and blubbered like a pot of hot mush or molasses.
They darted here and there like imps with
these pans. Then the liquid was poured in porcelain
boxes of various sizes. The whole place
seemed like a Devil’s smithyshop where chains
were being forged for lost souls. The odor was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
peculiar and penetrating. I must have absorbed
some of the dope, for I felt dizzy and
was glad to get outside in the fresh air.</p>

<p>There is no more melancholy sight, in China’s
teeming nightmare cities, than a drug-befuddled
victim staggering out in the early dawn
from some hasheesh house and tumbling down
in the street where he dreams he is in the
Celestial City with his ancestors. When he is
rudely awakened by a hungry rat gnawing his
hand or foot, the golden vision vanishes. In the
cold light of the morning, racked with nameless
pains, he crawls off to work at some mean job,
hoping to make enough for another night’s
opium dream in which to forget the hell of this
tormenting world.</p>

<h3>They Shot Spitballs</h3>

<p>A good story is told on our old friend
Colonel Luce of the Minnesota National Guard.
Two battalions of the Colonel’s regiment were
staging a sham battle at their summer encampment.</p>

<p>The defending forces took possession of a
small hill overlooking a river and destroyed
the only bridge by the simple method of tacking
up a notice on it stating that they had done
so. As a result it was quite a surprise to them
to see the attacking forces swarming across
the bridge, making extraordinary motions in
front of them with their hands.</p>

<p>“Hold on there, men!” shouted the Colonel’s
aide from the observer’s post, “you can’t cross
that bridge. It has been blown up.”</p>

<p>“Tuhel with that!” retorted the Major of
the other side, “we’re not crossing it, can’t you
see we are swimming the dang river?”</p>

<h3>One at a Time</h3>

<p>Years ago when W. A. McConnell was manager
of the Brooklyn theater he had a pet
parrot which was kept in the box office. During
a “big run” the ticket seller was wont to
say, “Get in line, please; one at a time, one at
a time, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>The bird escaped one afternoon, and
McConnell commissioned some boys to find it,
which they did on an old tree in a nearby park,
where several crows were making its feathers
fly. McConnell asked if the bird said anything
and the leader of the boys replied: “Yes, he
said, ‘Get in line, please; one at a time, one at
a time, gentlemen.’”</p>

dames and damsels, young as youth, wrinkled as an
